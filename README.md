# SQL Script Collection Repository

## What is the purpose of this Repository?

It is my personal collection of scripts that I have created while learning SQL. It contains SQL scripts written in self created and sample databases from the Web like [Adventure Works Sample Databases](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks).
Along the way, there will be updates on the folder structure and groupping of the files in the repository, but for now it will serve as a collection folder with a simple folder structure.  

## What's in this Repository?  

**Code**: All the SQL statements and command-line listings

**Data**: CSV, txt files, Excel amd PowerShell scripts

**Resources**: Updates to the resource list will be made from time to time and with addition of new ones
