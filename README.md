# SQL Script Collection Repository

## What is the purpose of this Repository?

It is my personal collection of scripts that I created while learning SQL and will contain SQL scripts written in various databases.
Along the way, there will be updates on the folder structure and groupping of the files in the repository, but for now it will serve as a collection folder.  

## What's in this Repository?  

**Code**: All the SQL statements and command-line listings

**Data**: CSV, TXT, Excel,PowerShell scripts and other

**Resources**: Updates to the resource list will be made from time to time and with addition of new ones
